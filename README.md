# Tech Assignment

TMDB Angular 2 Client

# Demo

# Assumptions

    - A movie can only be added in one collection
    - The validation of the user input does not happen with a custom directive (so we can use a more generic reactive form)
    - Rating happens on a single fixed test movie id to preserve data validity on their part

# Requirements

```
GOALS
The purpose of this project will be the search, display and categorization of movies into user defined collections. The application will be based on a free API, which will supply us with necessary movie data. At first, the user will be able to search and get a list of movies along with their details. Then, they will be able to select a couple of them and store them into a custom collection. In addition, they should be able to view and edit any collections they have created.
This project is divided into three main sections of development.
1. Search Page
a. This must be the home (default) page of the application
b. This page must contain a simple input where the user will be able to write a keyword to search for movies. Furthermore, custom  alidation logic must take place into an angular directive with the following two validation rules:
i. Minimum three (3) characters
ii. Allow only alphanumerics
c. Search results must be displayed using a pagination logic, and the following details must be shown:
i. poster_path
ii. title

iii. Vote_average
d. User must be able to navigate to MovieDetailsPage by clicking on the movie.

2. Movie Details Page
a. This page must be accessible through angular routing.
b. This page must be opened into a popup.
c. This page must fetch and display the following movie details: title, overview, poster_path, budget, release_date, revenue, vote_average, vote_count, spoken_languages
d. User must be able to post a rating for this movie. In order to accomplish this task, you need to get the sessionId for a guest user.

3. Movies Collections Page
a. This page must contain all the available movies collections of the user (store them in browserâ€™s local storage), each collection contains a list of movies.
b. User can navigate to collection create page. The needed information in order to create a collection is: title and description.
c. By clicking to a collection a new page should open with the list of collection movies from where user can remove a movie from the collection or see the movie details using MovieDetailsPage mentioned above.
d. User can add one or more movies to a collection by selecting the movies from the search results (SearchPage), then a popup should be opened with all the collections and user should select in which collection to add the selected movies.
```
